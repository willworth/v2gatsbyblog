    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm a coder with some professional experience looking for a full time role as a software developer.</p>
                <p>I've worked with wordpress and PHP, as well as done contract work in quality assurance with a 
                  python stack using flask and a large scale webscraping project. </p>
                <p>Most recently, I've been focusing on Javascript- with Node, express, and React. 
                   My desire to improve these skills led me to choose Gatsby to build this site (though, frankly, react seems to be overkill for a simple blog).  </p>
                <p> If you have any questions about the contents of this site, or want to talk about collaboration (I'm open to opensource work, too), please do get in touch either 
                via social networks.  (Facebook is my least favourite here, but I'll make an exception for you...</p>
